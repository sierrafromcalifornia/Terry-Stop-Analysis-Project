This project analyses records of police reported stops as documented by the Seatlle Police Department for the landmark Supreme Court case Terry v. Ohio. [make personal to other datasets]

In Terry v. Ohio (Links to an external site.), a landmark Supreme Court case in 1967-8, the court found that a police officer was not in violation of the "unreasonable search and seizure" clause of the Fourth Amendment, even though he stopped and frisked a couple of suspects only because their behavior was suspicious. Thus was born the notion of "reasonable suspicion", according to which an agent of the police may e.g. temporarily detain a person, even in the absence of clearer evidence that would be required for full-blown arrests etc. Terry Stops are stops made of suspicious drivers.

## Problem We're Tackling

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I will also translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create and what they should keep in mind as they enter into a new and highly competitive sector.

First, we'll tackle which type of films are worth focusing on and answer this by establishing which genres audiences favor most and which genres pull in the most return on investment (ROI).

Second, since Microsoft doesn't know anything about creating movies - we'll hand over proven recommendations on who to hire with experience in a production's most pivotal roles. From directors to writers and more, we'll do a deep dive into the most revered among each role. We'll even give a little insight into some of the leading film studios behind the scenes. 

Whether Microsoft wants to collaborate with the storytellers, bring them on as advisors, or simply have a greater understanding of the competition - that short list of people will be revealed.

## Data

Data will be used from the following source:
* __[Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/terry-stops)__

Data.gov's XYZ (`Terry_Stops.csv`): this dataset represents records of police reported stops under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). Each row represents a unique stop and contains perceived demographics of the subject, as reported by the officer making the stop and officer demographics as reported to the Seattle Police Department, for employment purposes.

## Methods & Results

I use logistic regression and decision tree algorithms to show:

Due to the datasets used and their associations with the current public discourse, I think these models can be tweaked according to different contexts in order to find additional, increas
